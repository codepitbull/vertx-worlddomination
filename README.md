## Vert.x for World Domination ##
The included project is a little prototype I built for my BedCon-talk about Vert.x. The included project is the basis for my own plans so I naturally won't provide everything (like the controller-implementation for my personal Jaeger-mech and advanced path finding).

## Running It ##

The project is simply a set of [Vert.x](http://vertx.io/) modules that can be run directly (each module contains a README.md showing the required command line).
Simply check out the project and run '__gradle build__' and you are good to go.

## TODO ##

This is still quite barebones but I will fill in a lot more information as I advance my plans.
